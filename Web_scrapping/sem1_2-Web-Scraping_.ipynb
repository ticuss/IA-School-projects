    "\n",
    "#### Web Scraping ,What is it?\n",
    "we can define it as using a program to get data from the web by pulling content without an API(Application Program Interface).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many sites have APIs you can connect to and use to pull data from. Such as the Twitter API. This is great! But sometimes you need data from a site that doesn't have an API. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Where is it used?\n",
    "Really any where you think it would be appropriate to gather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people have built web scraper to look for jobs & find apartments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies may search for email or contact informations\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitive analysis on a competing company, what prices do they have?\n",
    "\n",
    "Realtors may scrape housing listings\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand sentiment and words in reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime you want data!\n",

    "##### Consider the Ethics\n",
    "read sites terms of serive and robot files\n",
    "\n",
    "https://towardsdatascience.com/ethics-in-web-scraping-b96b18136f01\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some things you should consider before web scraping a website:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) You should check a site's terms and conditions before you scrape them. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Space out your requests so you don't overload the site's server, doing this could get you blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) Scrapers break after time - web pages change their layout all the time, you'll more than likely have to rewrite your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.) Web pages are usually inconsistent, more than likely you'll have to clean up the data after scraping it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.) Every web page and situation is different, you'll have to spend time configuring your scraper.\n"

    "\n",
    "    1.<DOCTYPE html> HTML documents will always start with this type declaration, letting the browser know its an HTML file.\n",
    "    2. The component blocks of the HTML document are placed between <html> and </html>.\n",
    "    3. Meta data and script connections (like a link to a CSS file or a JS file) are often placed in the <head> block.\n",
    "    4. The <title> tag block defines the title of the webpage (its what shows up in the tab of a website you're visiting).\n",
    "    5. Is between <body> and </body> tags are the blocks that will be visible to the site visitor.\n",

CSS uses tags such as **id** or **class** to connect an HTML element to a CSS feature, such as a particular color. **id** is a unique id for an HTML tag and must be unique within the HTML document, basically a single use connection. **class** defines a general style that can then be linked to multiple HTML tags. Basically if you only want a single html tag to be red, you would use an id tag, if you wanted several HTML tags/blocks to be red, you would create a class in your CSS doc and then link it to the rest of these blocks.\n",

    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is a Python library for parsing data out of HTML and XML files. It is useful for navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. The major concept with Beautiful Soup is that it allows you to access elements of your page by following the CSS structures, such as grabbing all links, all headers, specific classes, or more. It is a powerful library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we grab elements, Python makes it easy to write the elements or relevant components of the elements into other files, such as a CSV, that can be stored in a database or opened in other software.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Make the Soup\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have to turn the website code into a Python object. We have already imported the Beautiful Soup library, so we can start calling some of the methods in the libary. Replace **print(res.text)** with the following. This turns the text into an Python object named **soup**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important note: You need to specify the specific parser that Beautiful Soup uses to parse your text. This is done in the second argument of the BeautifulSoup function. The default is the built in Python parser, which we can call using **html.parser**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use **lxml** or **html5lib**. This is nicely described in the [documentation](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-a-parser).\n",
